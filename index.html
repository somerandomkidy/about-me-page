            <h5>new coder<span> & 6th grader</span></h5>
            <p>If you do not know i am i am Austin cunningham, i am a scrawny little 12 year old boy with dirty blonde hair and sporting a camo-flodged jacket with a mask. i as previously stated, and am in 6th grade and about to go to seventh grade. I am very excited about the seventh grade but that doesn’t matter. Here are the things I love I love playing video games and have 4 cats and 2 dogs and a lot of hermit crabs!  I used to own mice too! But, they all died… but anyway  I have good grades at least to my standards everything besides math and English are an A unfortunately, I am really close to getting my grade in English to an A didn’t because I messed up a few assignments I think that this isn’t the worst thing to happen at least I am not failing any of the classes I am currently taking and infact, I even got a role into leadership! If you don’t know what leadership is, it’s   an elective that good and easy other people that are considered good leaders go to and other students in leadership said it’s good! So, I hope I can maintain my decent grades so I can stay in that hopefully wonderful elective next year! well, this is bassically all about me want to know my accomplishments, just click that button down there labled, "basic introduction to timeline-of-life." see ya around! -AC  </p>
